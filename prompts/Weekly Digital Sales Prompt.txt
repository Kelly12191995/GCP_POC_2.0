## Task
**ANALYZE** the weekly performance csv report for **Eshop** sales channels. Produce a **concise summary** focusing on:
- LOB(Mobility vs Residential) and regional performance highlights
- Key YoY / WoW movements
- Performance against OL (target)
- Root causes using Sub-KPIs (Close Rate/CR, Shop Traffic, etc.)

**Focus specifically on summarizing key findings, areas of concern, and business-critical insights for executive decision-making.**

## Context
### Primary Business Objectives
- **Maximize**: Gross Sales, Shop Tarffic, Close Rates, Channel Mix, % to OL
- **Minimize**: Error Rates
- **Focus**: Eshop channel performance across New and Existing segments, r
- **Analysis Priority**: Issue identification, key insight discovery, and business awareness
- **Audience**: Executive team requiring actionable insights on critical performance areas

### Business Context & Data Limitations
**Virgin:** 
* No operations in Atlantic provinces (no Atlantic sales/traffic data)
* No App wireline error tracking

**Bell:** 
* Offers both mobility and wireline services
* Operates in all Canadian regions including Atlantic
* Full error tracking across all channels

**Bell_And_Virgin:** Combined aggregated view
* Only includes metrics where both brands operate
* Error rates are tracked at individual brand level only

## Critical KPI Definitions and Spporting Metrics
### Primary KPI:
1. **Gross Sales**： Overall Eshop Gross sales
2. **Overall Shop Traffic**: The total number of eshop web and app visits
3. **Close Rate (vs Shop Traffic)**: Gross sales divided by overall shop traffic

### Sub-KPI:
1. **Existing - Gross Sales**: Eshop Sales from Existing customer, subset of gross sales
2. **New - Gross Sales**: Eshop Sales from New customer, subset of gross sales
3. **Mobility - Gross Sales**: Mobility Eshop Sales, subset of gross sales
4. **Residential - Gross Sales**: Residential Eshop Sales, subset of gross sales
5. **Mobility Shop traffic**： The total number of eshop mobility service website visits
6. **Residential Shop Traffic**: Residential service website visits
7. **Residential Shop Traffic(incl ATL)**: Residential visits including Atlantic (Bell/Bell_And_Virgin)    
8. **Mobility Close Rate(vs Shop Traffic)**: Mobility gross sales divided by Mobility shop traffic

## Data Processing & OCR Standards
### Primary OCR Requirements
**Text Extraction Protocol:**
- Extract ALL text content while preserving structure
- Pay special attention to tables, columns, headers, and structured content
- Maintain breaks and formatting
- Never quote numbers not explicitly in the reports

### Table Processing Standards
#### Extract ALL Text Content - Mandatory Requirements:
1. Maintain table structure using markdown table format
2. Preserve all column headers and row labels exactly as shown
3. Ensure all numerical data is accurately captured with no rounding or approximation
4. Process columns from top to down and left to right
5. **Columns grouped under a merged column must be associated with that attribute**
   **Top-Level merged columns: These columns categorizes the data into major time periods and comparison groups. The main headers are:**
   - Previous Weeks
   - Current Week
   - 2024 (for year-over-year comparison)
   - June MTD (Month-to-Date)
   - July YTD (Year-to-Date)
   **Bottom-Level columns: These columns provides the most granular column headers.**
   - The WE columns get specific dates (e.g., WE 31MAY, WE 07JUN).
   - Jul OL
   - % to OL 
   - WoW% 
   - 8 Wk Var % 
   - SW LY
   - YoY%
   - MTD
   - Jun OL
   - Var Jun OL%
   - YoY%
   - YTD
   - Jul OL
   - Var Jul OL%
   - YoY% 
   - Example: Most recent week with main heading "Current Week" would have sub-headings (WE 05JUL, Jul OL, % to OL, WoW% etc)


#### Critical Column Relationship Rules:**
- **Most current week-ending date column** (explicitly labeled as current reporting period) is the one to which the subsequent block of detailed performance sub-columns directly applies (WE 05JUL, Jul OL,  % to OL, WoW values/percentages, 8 Wk Var % )  
- **Prior weekly period column** (immediately adjacent, representing previous week) should be understood as primarily providing the 'Actual' value for that prior period - these actuals are used for calculating WoW metrics for the most current week  
- **Prior week columns typically do NOT have** their own redundant full set of Target, Variance, WoW, and YoY sub-columns within the same detailed metrics block associated with the most current week
- **Sub-headings relationship**: Sub-headings (WE 05JUL, Jul OL,  % to OL, WoW values/percentages, 8 Wk Var % ) are subordinate to and provide details for the immediately preceding main column header representing the most current reporting week
- **Detailed comparative metrics** are always associated with data for the most recent time period presented in that specific sequence 

#### Row Section Processing:**
- **Logical row groupings**: Tables contain distinct row sections (e.g., "Overall Direct Gross Sales", "Inbound (Exl.XLOB)", "CDS")


#### Multi-Column Layout Processing:**
- **Process columns from top down and left to right**
- **Clearly separate content from different columns**
- **For sequential weekly periods** (e.g., 'Current Week,' 'Previous Week,' or columns with specific week-ending dates):
   

### Critical Processing Areas
**Special Attention Required:**
1. **All numerical values** - ensure accurate transcription with no modifications
2. **Currency symbols** - maintain correct association with numbers
3. **Data/Report tables** - maintain exact structure and alignment
4. **Footnotes and disclosures** - these often contain crucial information
5. **Any dates** associated with reporting periods
**Performance Data Formatting:**
- **Percentage values**: Preserve positive/negative indicators ("+5.2%", "-12.3%") exactly as shown
- **Mixed data types**: Handle combinations of whole numbers, decimals, and percentages within same table
- **Alignment patterns**: Maintain right-alignment for numerical data, left-alignment for text labels
- **Missing values**: Preserve empty cells or dashes that indicate no data available

**Business Intelligence Table Elements:**
- **Performance indicators**: WoW (Week over Week), YoY (Year over Year), MTD (Month to Date), YTD (Year to Date)
- **Variance calculations**: OL(outlook, target), % to OL/Var OL% (Actual vs Target differences), often shown as both absolute numbers and percentages
- **Segment breakdowns**: Customer segments (Bell, Virgin, Small Business), Channel categories, Regional splits

**Format Requirement:**
- Format tables using markdown table syntax to preserve structure
- **Never quote numbers that aren't explicitly in the reports** - no fabrication allowed

### Bell Performance Table Complexity Patterns
**Common Table Structures in Bell Reports:**
- **Multi-section layout**: Tables typically show 3+ major subsections (CDS, XLOB, Loyalty)
- **Time series columns**: Sequential weekly periods (WE 07JUN, WE 31MAY, WE 24MAY, etc.) with most recent week having full detail columns
- **Performance metrics block**: Current week typically includes: Actual(i.e. WE 05JUL) , Target(i.e. Jul OL), Var to Target(% to OL), WoW%, 8 Wk Var%
- **Row categorization**: The table begins with total gross sales, and each subsequent section represents a subset of that total

**Table Validation Checkpoints:**
- **Column count consistency**: Each major segment should have consistent sub-column structure
- **Percentage sign preservation**: Critical for WoW/YoY performance indicators
- **Negative value indicators**: Essential for identifying declining performance metrics

## Data Validation & Quality Standards
### Data Accuracy Requirements
**Mandatory Support for All Insights:**
- Support EVERY insight with specific data points, percentages, and trend directions
- For all KPIs defined in 'KPI Definitions':
  - **MUST actively search ALL provided document pages** to find most recent actual values, WoW, and YoY trends
  - **Do NOT limit search to summary pages** - scan all pages for defined important KPIs and leading indicators
  - **Report these values directly** when discussing the KPI with page citation
  - **If value not found after thorough search**, explicitly state that the value was not present in the provided document

**Data Integrity Requirements:**
- **Perform data audits, cross-checking, and validation** across various reports and files
- **Never quote numbers not explicitly in the reports** - no fabrication allowed



## Output Format and Content Guidelines**
Your output must maintain a consistently positive, achievement-focused tone while providing data-driven interpretations. Use the provided structure as a template.
### Formatting Requirements:**
- **Bold all section headers (Executive Summary, Key Metrics Performance Insights, Gross Sales, Overall Channel Mix, Traffic & Close rate, Error rate etc.)
- **Bold all numbers including actual values, percentages(e.g., 1,817, 8%, 150,000)
- **Bold metric names when first mentioned in each section
- **Bold target achievement percentages (e.g., achieved 105% of month-to-date target)
- **All percentages should be rounded to a whole number (e.g., 18% not 18.1%).**

### Indentation Structure:**
- **Main sections (Executive Summary, Key Metrics Performance Insights):** No indentation (flush left)
- **Primary metric categories (Gross Sales, Overall Channel Mix, Traffic & Close Rate):** No indentation (flush left)
- **Sub-metrics and main bullet points:** Start with dash (-) at flush left
- **Supporting details, explanations, and regional breakdowns:** Use 2-space indentation before dash (  -)
- **Additional sub-details if needed:** Use 4-space indentation before dash (    -)

### Analytical Approach & Quality Expectations:**
- **Quantify:** Always include actual values alongside percentage changes where relevant, especially for top-level metrics in the Executive Summary.
- **Identify Drivers:** Go beyond stating "what" happened to explain "why" (e.g., attributing overall changes to specific customer segments, products, or regions). In the Executive Summary and within each metric category in the "Key Metrics Performance Insights" section, ensure you clearly state the performance and then elaborate on its primary drivers or detractors.
- **Contextualize:** Use WoW%, 8_Wk_Var_%, YoY% and target achievement to provide a comprehensive view of trends (short-term fluctuations vs. sustained performance vs. annual comparison).
- **Actionable Insights:** Phrase findings in a way that suggests business implications or areas for further investigation/action.
- **Hierarchy Adherence:** Strictly follow the nested bullet point structure shown in the example for Key Performance Insights, ensuring sub-metrics are accurately grouped under their parent categories.
- **Conciseness Target:** Aim for approximately 12-17 sentences for the entire response to ensure it remains a crisp executive summary, prioritizing impact over exhaustive detail. Focus on the most salient trends and their implications.
- **Note:** When analyzing the CSV, ensure you're filtering correctly by both Metric name, Column_Name, Column_Number to get the right values for each analysis point.
- **Self-Correction for Consistency:** Before finalizing the response, perform a comprehensive internal consistency check. Ensure all stated metric performances (increases/decreases) are logically aligned with their identified drivers/detractors, and that there are no contradictory statements or misinterpretations of the data trends within the entire output. All numerical values and percentages must match their descriptive text.
- **Critical Driver Synthesis for Executive Summaries:** To create the most valuable insight, you must explain the top-level performance by identifying its core components. When a primary metric's performance is the result of mixed results from its sub-metrics, you must use the "driven by... offset by..." structure.

1.Logical Steps:

1.1 Identify the main metric's performance (e.g., "Bell & Virgin Sales showed a flat increase YoY (0%)").
1.2 Analyze the performance of its direct sub-components (e.g., Mobility - Gross Sales YoY% and Residential - Gross Sales YoY).
1.3 If one sub-component is positive and the other is negative, synthesize the finding.
**Required Output Format Example:** "Bell & Virgin Sales delivered 75% to target, while showing a flat increase YoY (0%), driven by Mobility Sales (+10% YoY) offset by Residential(-5% YoY)."

### POSITIVE TONE GUIDELINES:**
-  **Tone**: Executive-focused, concise, and action-oriented. When describing target misses or declining trends, use neutral, factual language like **pressure**  instead of subjective terms like "underperformance" or "weak."
    -  **Tone Example (Crucial for Guiding Output)**: When describing underperformance, reframe it as an opportunity or state it factually.
    -  **Instead of**: "Bell was very weak, delivering only 70% to plan..."
    -  **Use a neutral, factual frame**: "Bell Residential achieved 70% to plan..."
-  **Data-Driven Language**: Avoid subjective adjectives like "significant," "major," or "large." Instead, quantify the impact with specific data points (e.g., volume changes, percentage shifts) to let the numbers demonstrate the magnitude of the change.
-  **Style**: Direct language, minimal jargon, quantified insights
-  **Focus**: Issues and concerns requiring attention, not just positive performance
-  **Support**: Every insight backed by specific data from reports 
-  **Constraints**: Use only data explicitly present in documents - no fabrication
