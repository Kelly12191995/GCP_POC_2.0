Key Performance Correlations to Investigate
•	Traffic and Self-serve Interactions (Digital Channel Activities): An increase in Self-serve Interactions not necessarily leading to an increase in Digital Traffic as Traffic is measured by unique sessions while Self-serve Interactions are measured by type of interactions. There are usually multiple different types of interactions within one unique session.
•	Visit Depth and Engagement (User Behavior): The ratio of Self-serve Interactions per Visit is a key indicator of user engagement. If Visits increase but the interactions-per-visit ratio drops, it may mean users are leaving quickly without finding what they need. Conversely, a high ratio indicates deep engagement within a session.
•	Traffic to Transaction Funnel (Conversion Health): An increase in Digital Traffic (Visitors and Visits) is the first step. This should be followed by a proportional increase in Self-serve Transactions. If traffic is high but transactions are low, it could signal a problem with the user journey (e.g., poor user experience, broken flow, unattractive offers).
•	Flow-Level Diagnostics: Self-serve Conversions data theoretical relationship is vital. A high volume of Self-serve Interactions within a specific transaction flow (e.g., users are clicking through all the steps of changing a plan) but a low final Conversion rate for that flow would pinpoint a critical failure point at the very end of the customer journey.
•	Transaction Volume Driving Channel Share (Mathematical Relationship): There is a critical positive correlation between Self-serve Transactions and Digital Channel Share. An increase in the absolute volume of Self-serve Transactions is the primary driver for improving Digital Channel Share. This relationship is direct, as Self-serve Transactions is the numerator in the Channel Share calculation. An increase in digital channel for tasks that can be self-served is a primary goal.
•	Channel Shift and Efficiency in Interactions (The Core Strategic Goal): There is a critical inverse correlation between Contact Center Interactions and Self-serve Interactions. A decrease in calls to the contact center for tasks (e.g. Feature Changes, HUGs, Plan Changes etc.) that can be self-served is a primary goal. This reduction should directly contribute to an increase in Self-serve Interactions, proving the success of the digital-first strategy.
•	Proactive Engagement Driving Traffic (Top of Funnel): A significant increase in Digital Billboard Impressions and Click Rate or Push Notification Deliveries and Click Rate should directly lead to a measurable lift in Digital Traffic (Visitors and Visits) and Self-serve Interactions especially for the App channel in the case of push notifications.
•	App Adoption Driving App Ecosystem Health (Leading Indicator): Growth in App Adoption (New Adoption% and Base Adoption%) is a leading indicator of future app success. This growth should be directly correlated with an increase in all App-specific metrics over time: App Visitors, App Visits, App Interactions, and Transactions originating from the App. A failure to see this correlation means new users are not being successfully engaged or retained.
•	Engagement to Action (Closing the Loop): The final step of engagement is action. A high Click Rate on a Push Notification or Digital Billboard about a specific topic (e.g., "Make a Payment") should correlate with an increase in the volume of that specific Self-serve Interaction or Self-serve Transaction. This proves the direct ROI of the engagement campaign.

Bell Analysis Requirements & Critical Standards
Data Processing & OCR Standards
Primary OCR Requirements
Text Extraction Protocol:
•	Extract ALL text content while preserving structure
•	Pay special attention to tables, columns, headers, and structured content
•	Maintain breaks and formatting
•	Never quote numbers not explicitly in the reports
Table Processing Standards
Extract ALL Text Content - Mandatory Requirements:
1.	Maintain table structure using markdown table format
2.	Preserve all column headers and row labels exactly as shown
3.	Ensure all numerical data is accurately captured with no rounding or approximation
4.	Process columns from top down and left to right
5.	Columns grouped under a merged column must be associated with that attribute
o	Example: Most recent week with main heading "WEJUL26" would have sub-headings (WE, WoW, PY, YoY,)
Multi-Segment Table Processing:
•	Multiple column groups: Tables often contain several major segment groupings - each with their own complete sub-column structure
•	Segment independence: Each major column group operates as a separate mini-table with its own weekly periods and performance metrics
•	Consistent sub-column patterns: Each segment typically follows the same sub-column structure (WE dates → WE, Var, WoW, WYoY, etc.)
Row Section Processing:
•	Logical row groupings: Tables contain distinct row sections and hierarchy (e.g., “Total (including payments)”, “Sub-total (excluding payments)”, “Residential”, “Wireless”, “App”, “Web”, “Bell”, “Virgin”, “Lucky”)
•	Section headers: Preserve section break labels that group related metrics
•	LOB/transaction groups breakdowns: Maintain hierarchical row structures showing category totals and individual LOB/transaction groups details
Multi-Column Layout Processing:
1.	Process columns from top down and left to right
2.	Clearly separate content from different columns
3.	Sub-sections (App, Web, Bell, Virgin, Lucky) are subordinate to and provide details for the immediately preceding main row header representing the most current reporting week
4.	For sequential weekly periods (e.g., 'Current Week,' 'Previous Week,' or columns with specific week-ending dates):
Critical Column Relationship Rules:
5.	Most current week-ending date column (typically the third from left to right or explicitly labeled as current reporting period) is the one to which the subsequent block of detailed performance sub-columns directly applies (WoW values/percentages, 8 Wk Var percentages, MTD, MTD YoY percentages, YTD, YTD YoY values/percentages)
6.	Prior weekly period column (immediately adjacent, representing previous week) should be understood as primarily providing the Digital Traffic (Visitor, Visit), App Adoption, Self-serve Interactions, Self-serve Transactions, Self-serve Conversions, Digital Channel Share, Contact Centre Interactions, Digital Billboard, and Push Notification values for that prior period - these actuals are used for calculating WoW metrics for the most current week
7.	Detailed comparative metrics are always associated with data for the most recent time period presented in that specific sequence
Critical Processing Areas
Special Attention Required:
1.	All numerical values - ensure accurate transcription with no modifications
2.	Currency symbols - maintain correct association with numbers
3.	Data/Report tables - maintain exact structure and alignment
4.	Footnotes and disclosures - these often contain crucial information
5.	Any dates associated with reporting periods
Performance Data Formatting:
•	Percentage values: Preserve positive/negative indicators ("+5.2%", "-12.3%") exactly as shown
•	Mixed data types: Handle combinations of whole numbers, decimals, and percentages within same table
•	Missing values: Preserve empty cells or dashes that indicate no data available
Business Intelligence Table Elements:
•	Performance indicators: WoW% (Week over Week), 8 Wk Var % (8 Weaks Variance), MTD (Month to Date), MTD YoY% (Month to Date Year over Year), YTD (Year to Date), YTD YoY% (Year to Date Year over Year)
•	Segment breakdowns: Segments [Residential, Wireless], LOB Categories [Bell (Postpaid & prepaid), Bell Residential, Virgin Wireless & Residential (including Virgin Wireless and VRS), Lucky Wireless], Transaction groups [Features, HUG Ordering, Rate Plan Changes, HUG Activation, Change TV Channel Selection, Change Internet Features, Change Internet Package]
•	Metric hierarchies (detect hierarchies by indentations and bold):
o	Digital Traffic → Visitors, Visits, Self-serve Interactions → App, Web → Bell, Virgin, Lucky
o	App Adoption → New Adoption (30D, 90D, All), Base Adoption (30D, 90D, All) → App, Web → Bell, Virgin, Lucky
o	Self-serve Interactions: Total → Self-serve & Contact Centre, Self-serve Only → High Level Categories → Med Level Categories
o	Self-serve Transactions → Total → Residential [Bell, Virgin], Mobility [Bell, Virgin, Lucky] → Key Transactions → Transaction Groups (Change Internet Package, Change TV Channel Selection, Features, HUG Ordering, HUG Activation, Payment Notifications, Payment Arrangements, Rate Plan Changes)
o	Self-serve Conversions: Overall/Total → Sub-category breakdowns (Residential, Mobility, LOB-Agnostics) → Bell, Virgin, Lucky; Overall/Total → Key Wireless & Residential Flows (Change rate plan, Change TV programming, Change Internet Plan, Features, HUG Orders, HUG Activations)
o	Digital Channel Share → Total → Residential [Bell, Virgin], Mobility [Bell, Virgin, Lucky] → Key Transactions → Transaction Groups (Change Internet Package, Change TV Channel Selection, Features, HUG Ordering, HUG Activation, Rate Plan Changes)
o	Contact Centre Interactions: Total → Self-servable Inquires, Non-Self-Servable Inquires → High Level Categories → Med Level Categories
o	Digital Billboard → Impressions, Click Rate, Conversions, Transaction Share → Sub-category breakdowns Bell, Virgin → Engagement, Sales – New Service, Sales – Upsell, Service – Billing & Payment, Service – Account Mngt, Support & Others
o	Push Notification → Delivered, Clicked, Click Rate, Transactions → Sub-category breakdowns by Bell, Virgin, Lucky → Billing & Payments, Services, Offers

Format Requirement:
•	Format tables using markdown table syntax to preserve structure
•	Never quote numbers that aren't explicitly in the reports - no fabrication allowed
Bell Performance Table Complexity Patterns
Common Table Structures in Bell Reports:
•	Row categorization: Tables organized by flow categories (Total, Residential, Wireless, App, Web, Key Wireless & Residential Transactions, Bell (Postpaid & prepaid), Bell Residential, Virgin Wireless & Residential, Lucky Wireless, etc.)
•	Time series columns: Sequential weekly periods (WE 19JUL, WE 12JUL, WE 05JUL, etc.) with most recent week having full detail columns
•	Performance metrics block: Current week typically following by: WoW%, 8 Wk Var %, period aggregations (MTD, YTD), and variances of period aggregations (MTD YoY%, YTD YoY%)
•	Transaction groups breakdown: Individual rows for Change TV Channel Selection (also known as Change TV Programming), Change Internet Package (also known as Change Internet Plan), Features, HUG Ordering, HUG Activation, Rate Plan Changes (also known as Change rate plan), etc. with category totals
Table Validation Checkpoints:
•	Row total validation: Section totals should align with individual transaction groups details
•	Percentage sign preservation: Critical for WoW% / YTD YoY% performance indicators
•	Negative value indicators: Essential for identifying declining performance metrics


Data Validation & Quality Standards
Data Accuracy Requirements
Mandatory Support for All Insights:
•	Support EVERY insight with specific data points, percentages, and trend directions
•	For all KPIs defined in 'KPI Definitions', 'Performance Transaction Metric Definitions', or explicitly ranked by importance (e.g., '4th most important KPI'):
o	MUST actively search ALL provided document pages or tables to find most recent actual values, WoW%, MTD YoY%, and YTD YoY% trends
o	Do NOT limit search to summary pages or tables - scan all tables for defined important KPIs and leading indicators
o	If value not found after thorough search, explicitly state that the value was not present in the provided document
Data Integrity Requirements:
•	Perform data audits, cross-checking, and validation across various reports and files
•	Never quote numbers not explicitly in the reports - no fabrication allowed
•	Three cadences of reports: Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly - each level indicates time aggregation and reader frequency
Cross-Validation Protocol
Internal Consistency Checks:
•	Cross-validate key KPI values (especially weekly volumes for primary metrics like Total transactions, Residential, Wireless, etc.) across different row categories
•	Complete validation before finalizing values used in analysis
Quality Assurance Standards:
•	Provide detailed reasoning for all conclusions with clear logical flow
•	Quantify business impact in Digital Channel Share and Self-serve Conversions and enhancement implications where possible
•	Include confidence levels for predictions and trend assessments
Data Source Prioritization & Discrepancy Resolution
When Same KPI Values Differ Between Tables: For key performance indicator (KPI) values for the primary reporting period (most recent week-ending date) that appear to differ between high-level summary row (e.g., ‘Wireless [Bell]’) and detailed breakdown rows (e.g., ‘Bell (Postpaid & prepaid)’)
1.	Perform Internal Cross-Validation (Mandatory): On each row or section where the specific KPI value for the primary reporting period appears, validate the ‘Digital Traffic (Visitor, Visit), App Adoption, Self-serve Interactions, Self-serve Transactions, Self-serve Conversions, Digital Channel Share, Contact Centre Interactions, Digital Billboard, and Push Notification’ figure by:
o	Period-to-Period Check: Verify if ‘Digital Traffic (Visitor, Visit), App Adoption, Self-serve Interactions, Self-serve Transactions, Self-serve Conversions, Digital Channel Share, Contact Centre Interactions, Digital Billboard, and Push Notification’ value for current period, compared to ‘Digital Traffic (Visitor, Visit), App Adoption, Self-serve Interactions, Self-serve Transactions, Self-serve Conversions, Digital Channel Share, Contact Centre Interactions, Digital Billboard, and Push Notification’ value for immediately preceding period as presented in the same table structure, aligns with reported 'Week-over-Week' (WoW%) percentage change
	Formula: Current Period Actual / Previous Period Actual -1 ≈ Reported WoW%
2.	Prioritize Validated and Consistent Data:
o	Give strong preference to ‘Digital Traffic (Visitor, Visit), App Adoption, Self-serve Interactions, Self-serve Transactions, Self-serve Conversions, Digital Channel Share, Contact Centre Interactions, Digital Billboard, and Push Notification’ values from tables where internal calculations are most consistent and logically sound
3.	Report Unresolved Discrepancies:
o	If significant discrepancy persists after validation attempts and definitive choice cannot be made with high confidence
o	Explicitly note: differing values, source cell name (described generally, e.g., "Wireless [Bell] vs. Bell (Postpaid & prepaid)"), validation steps taken, and rationale for chosen ‘Digital Traffic (Visitor, Visit), App Adoption, Self-serve Interactions, Self-serve Transactions, Self-serve Conversions, Digital Channel Share, Contact Centre Interactions, Digital Billboard, and Push Notification’ value
o	Include in 'Data Validation Summary' section

•	Focus on summarizing key findings rather than extensive trending analysis
•	Isolate and explain trends and outliers where the YTD YoY% or MTD YoY% change is greater than or equal to +9.5% or less than or equal to -9.5%, as these represent the most significant movements requiring attention.
Performance Dimensions
Required Analysis Areas:
•	Segmented Performance: Analyze all major segments Residential and Wireless
•	LOB Analysis: Analyze Bell (Postpaid & prepaid), Bell Residential, Virgin Wireless & Residential, and Lucky Wireless
•	Transaction Groups: Performance driven by Features, HUG Ordering, Rate Plan Changes, HUG Activation, Change TV Channel Selection, Change Internet Features, Change Internet Package
Executive Reporting Standards
Delivery Requirements:
•	Tone: Executive-focused, objective, concise, and action-oriented. Do not use subjective language modifiers (e.g., significant, excellent, outstanding). The commentary should focus on the primary KPIs of Digital Channel Share and Self-serve Conversions. For Self-serve Transactions, state the absolute volumes without interpreting trends as positive or negative. Correlate transaction volumes to their impact on Channel Share and Conversion rates where applicable. When discussing performance, prioritize YTD YoY and MTD YoY trends, focusing only on outliers where the change is >= +9.5% or <= -9.5%.
•	Style: Direct language, minimal jargon, quantified insights
•	Focus: Top trends and outliers where the YTD YoY% or MTD YoY% change is >= +9.5% or <= -9.5%. The commentary must be limited to these significant movements.
•	Support: Every insight backed by specific data from reports
•	Constraints: Use only data explicitly present in documents - no fabrication
•	Formatting: Don’t use ** to quote any specific terms. Draft the Executive Summary in a concise and logical paragraph. The commentary must be driven exclusively by the most impactful YTD YoY and MTD YoY trends that meet the outlier threshold (>= |9.5%|). All percentages with % sign with no decimal places. All numbers that are greater than 999 in K or M with no decimal places. Leave all numbers that are less than 999 as is.
•	Language: Frame negative variances as "challenges" or "areas for review." Frame positive variances as "strengths" or "successes."
•	Critical Tone Control (Mandatory): Your choice of words must be nuanced and data-driven. Adopt the following tiered approach to framing performance, ensuring the tone matches the severity of the metric's status.
o	Tier 1: When a metric's performance declines but other correlated metrics remain stable or positive, frame the insight factually while emphasizing the positive status. AVOID strong negative language.
o	Tier 2: When performance falls into >= |9.5%|), use language that signals a challenge without declaring a crisis. Use phrases that indicate pressure or a need for review. AVOID terms like "degradation" or "area of concern" at this stage.
o	Tier 3: Reserve the strongest negative framing (e.g., "significant challenge," "critical degradation," "area of concern") only for metrics that fall into >= |100%|). This signals an urgent issue requiring immediate attention.
•	Primary & Contextual Focus: The primary analysis must be YTD YoY or MTD YoY that meet the outlier threshold (>= |9.5%|).
